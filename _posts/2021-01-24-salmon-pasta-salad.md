    1. Cook the pasta in a saucepan with enough cold water so it's completely covered. Add a pinch of salt and cook on a low-medium heat for 15 minutes.
    2. Cook the salmon fillets according to packet instructions. I used fresh salmon so I pan fried with it 1 tsp of vegetable oil for 2-3 minutes on each side (bottom, top, left and right). Once cooked, set aside.
    3. Inbetween turning the salmon, chop the celery, cucumber, and tomatoes. Place into a bowl and add the sweetcorn. 
    4. When the salmon is finished cooking, your pasta might be done. Check to see if the softness is to your taste (I prefer al dente pasta so I would usually take it off the heat at this point).
    5. When the pasta is done to your liking, place in a colander and rinse with cold water to prevent it from overcooking. 
    6. Remove the salmon skin and combine it with the pasta and vegetables into a big bowl. 
    7. Add the yoghurt, mayonnaise, mustard, lemon juice, and pepper and stir in gently. The salmon should fall apart easily.
    8. Leave to sit for at least 10 minutes before serving.  
    8. Stir the mixture again. Add the salted peanuts on top of the salad when serving to prevent them getting soggy. Serve with a crusty roll on the side.
