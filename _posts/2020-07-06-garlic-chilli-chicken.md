    1. Heat the oil in a pan over a medium heat and add the garlic slivers. It is very important not to burn the garlic, so watch the pan and move the garlic around the pan until they become soft and are just beginning to brown.
    2. Add the onion and fry for around 3 minutes until soft and translucent, sprinkling a little salt over the onions to help release moisture.
    3. Stir in the garlic and ginger paste, and chillies. Fry for around 20 seconds.
    4. Increase the heat to medium-high, add the ground spices and tomato purée and sizzle for a further 30 seconds, stirring continuously.
    5. Add half the base curry sauce and bring to a rolling simmer. Be sure to scrape any sauce that caramelizes on the sides of the pan back into the sauce.
    6. Pour in the rest of the base sauce, the chicken, and the cooking stock. Let this bubble without disturbing until the chicken is heated through and your sauce consistency is how you like it.
    7. Stir in the dried fenugreek leaves and check for seasoning, adding salt to taste. Sprinkle with chopped corriander, dried garlic flakes and chilli rings as you like.
