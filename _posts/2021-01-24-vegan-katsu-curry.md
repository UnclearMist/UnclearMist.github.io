    1. Make the sauce first so you can set it aside while cooking and simply reheat in the microwave when everything is ready. Blitz the onion, garlic and ginger in a food processor. I find this the most time saving method, but if you don't have a food processor finely chop the onion and garlic and grate the ginger and combine. 
    2. Fry the onion, garlic and ginger in 1 tbsp of vegetable oil and cook until soft on a low to medium heat to avoid burning.
    3. Add the turmeric, curry powder and chilli flakes, maintaing a low to medium heat and stir until combined.
    4. Add 1 tbsp of corn flour and combine. This will thicken the sauce.
    5. Add the stock bit by bit and mix in well. Then add the coconut milk, soy sauce and sugar. Leave to simmer on a low heat for 5-10 minutes. Set aside once done.
    6. Rinse the rice under a cold water tap for 1 minute in a sieve to wash away excess starch. This will help prevent the rice getting too sticky. 
    7. Transfer rice to a saucepan with two parts water to one part rice (this is why I use mugs to measure rice and pasta. 1 mug of rice means 2 mugs of water). Add a pinch of salt and cook on a medium heat until the water begins to bubble. Next, cover the saucepan with a lid and turn the heat down to its lowest setting and simmer for about 15 minutes.
    8. Chop the peppers into large slices. Place the milk, flour, and breadcrumbs into separate bowls. 
    9. One by one, cover your pepper slices in milk, then flour, then milk again and then the breadcrumbs. This should help the panko breadcrumbs stick well.
    10. When all of the peppers are coated, check how your rice is getting on. If you can still see water at the top wait another 5-10 minutes until you can no longer see water at the top.
    11. Heat the remaining oil in a frying pan. Fry the peppers on either side until the breadcrumbs are golden.
    12. Reheat the katsu sauce in the microwave and serve. To achieve the rice tower, spoon each portion of rice into a cappucino mug and press down lightly, then turn it over onto the plate. Garnish with salad if desired.
