    * 900g plain white flour + extra for dusting
    * Scant 1 tbsp salt
    * 2 tbsp baking powder
    * 300ml full-fat milk
    * 1 7g sachet dried yeast
    * 2 tbsp sugar
    * 3 eggs

    1. Sift the flour, salt and baking powder into a large bowl.
    2. Heat the milk in the microwave or on the hob until hand hot.
    3. Pour the heated milk into a jug, add the yeast and the sugar and whisk. Cover with a cloth and leave in a warm place for around 20 minutes.
    4. Lightly beat the eggs and yoghurt together. Pour the yeasty milk mixture into the flour, along with the whisked eggs and yoghurt. Mix everything to combine.
    5. Tip the dough out onto a work surface and knead for about 10 minutes until you have a soft, slightly sticky dough ball. Brush the inside of a bowl with oil and place the dough back in the bowl. Cover and allow to rise for at least 1 hour and up to 24 hours. Longer rising times achieve a tasty sourdough.
    6. Pull a chunk of dough about the size of a tennis ball from the risen dough. Using your hands or a rolling pin, roll the ball out on a lightly floured work surface into a flat, circular disc or teardrop shape around 5mm thick. Slap the disc between your hands to get all the excess flour off.
    7. Heat a dry frying pan over a high heat and, when very hot, place the naan in it. It will begin to cook the underside and bubble the top. Check the bottom regularly to ensure it doesn't burn. If it begins to get too dark, turn the naan over to get a bit of colour on the other side. Each naan should take no more than 3-5 minutes to cook.
    8. Move the cooked naan to a plate.
    9. Brush the naan with a melted butter, garlic and coriander mixture.
    10. Keep warm whilst cooking the remaining naan.
