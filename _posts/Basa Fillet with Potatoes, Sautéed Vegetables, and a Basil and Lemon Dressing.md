    1. Boil the potatoes in water with a pinch of salt on medium heat for 20-25 minutes until soft.
    2. Cook the fish according to packet instructions. In this recipe I used frozen basa fillets so I drizzled a bit of lemon juice over them with a pinch of parsley and cooked in the oven for 15 minutes. 
    3. While the potatoes and fish are cooking, begin making your basil and lemon drizzle. Combine olive oil, basil, and lemon juice and blitz in a food processor. If you don't have a food processor you can finely chop the basil with a knife and mix together in a bowl.
    4. When the fish and potatoes are about 5 minutes away from being cooked, heat the vegetable oil in a frying pan. Once hot, add the vegetables and garlic. Keep the mixture moving to avoid burning and sauté for 3-4 minutes.
    5. Dish up the potatoes first and put 1/2 a tbsp of butter over each. Then serve up the vegetables followed by the basa fillet and apply the basil and lemon drizzle.
