    1. For the paste, chop and place the shallots, lemongrass, garlic, ginger and chillis into a food processor and process until very finely chopped.
    2. Heat the oil into a sauce pan and add the paste, cinnamon, cloves, star anise and cardamom. Stir until aromatic. 
    3. Add the diced beef steak and additional lemongrass and stir for 1 minute.
    4. Add the coconut milk, tamarind paste, water, and stir frequently on a medium heat until the beef is almost cooked. 
    5. Add the kafir lime leaves, desicated coconut and sugar and stir until well blended.
    6. Change the heat to low, cover the sauce pan with a lid and simmer for 1.5 hours.
    7. When the curry is about 20 minutes away from being done, rinse the white rice in a sieve under a tap to remove excess starch.
    8. Put the rice into a small saucepan with 800ml of cold water, 3 tbsp of desicated coconut and the remainder of the coconut milk.
    9. Heat the rice on a medium heat until it starts bubbling. Then turn the heat down to the lowest setting, cover, and cook until the water is gone.
    10. Add additional salt and sugar to the curry depending on your taste and serve.
