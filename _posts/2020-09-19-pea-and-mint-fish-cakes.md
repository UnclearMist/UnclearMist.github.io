    1. Peel and chop the potatoes into 1-inch cubes. Place into a pan with cold water and a pinch of salt. Boil on a medium heat until soft (approximately 15-20 minutes). 
    2. While the potatoes are boiling, cook the fish according to packet instructions and boil the peas in a separate saucepan (cooking methods for fish differ depending on whether they are fresh or frozen).  
    3. Drain the potatoes and mash together. Add the peas and fish and mash lightly again. Allow the mixture to cool slightly so it doesn't hurt to touch them.
    4. Add the lemon zest, mint, and parsley. Season with a little salt and pepper and stir together with a wooden spoon. 
    5. Divide the flour, egg and breadcrumbs between 3 plates. Use clean hands to form the potato and fish mixture into patties. 
    6. Lightly coat each patty in flour, then egg, then breadcrumbs.
    7. Heat the oil in a large frying pan over a medium heat. Pan fry the fish cakes until golden brown on each side. 
    8. Serve however you like. I have served with a salad for this recipe, but you can improvise to your taste! Freeze the fish cakes you don't use today in a tupperware box.

I've opted for a mixture of salmon, haddock and cod for my recipe but you can adjust to your taste.
