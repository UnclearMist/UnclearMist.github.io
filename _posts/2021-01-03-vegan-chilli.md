    1. Turn the slow cooker on high if using. Heat the oil in a sauce pan on a low-medium heat.
    2. Add the chopped onion and carrot. Cook for 5-6 minutes stirring occasionally. 
    3. Add the chopped garlic, tomato puree and spices. Keep it stirring so it doesn't burn. 
    4. Add the red wine and tinned tomatoes. Simmer on a low heat for 3-4 minutes. 
    5. Add the vegetable stock and a pinch of salt and pepper and simmer for 5 minutes on a low heat.
    6. Add the bay leaves and oregano. Then transfer the mix to the slow cooker on high heat (if using). If using a saucepan to simmer, cover it with the lid slightly ajar.
    7. After 30 minutes, add the vegetables and kidney beans. Simmer for another 30 minutes and begin preparing the rice.
    8. Place the rice in a sieve and wash under cold water thoroughly. Transfer to a saucepan and add 1.2 litres of cold water and a pinch of salt. Heat on a low-medium heat until the water begins to bubble. Then turn down the heat to low and cover with a lid and simmer for 17-20 minutes. Try not to open the lid whilst the rice is cooking as this can cause it to get sticky. You can use a fork to check for water at the bottom after 15 minutes.
    9. Serve and garnish with coriander. If you want to present it like my picture, transfer the rice to a cappucino mug and tip it on top of the chilli.

I prefer to use the slow cooker to simmer the chilli because it avoids burnt food at the bottom of the pan and you don't have to keep stirring it occassionally.
