    1. Finely chop the onions, carrots and garlic. Cut the mushrooms and plum tomatoes into halves.
    2. Heat the oil in a pan over medium heat. Once heated, add the chopped carrots and onions. Stir regularly for 5 minutes.
    3. Add the chopped garlic, rosemary and mushrooms. Stir regularly for another 3 minutes. 
    4. Add the mince stir until browned.
    5. Add the red wine and simmer for 4 minutes.
    6. Add the tinned tomatoes, followed by the plum tomatoes and tomato puree.
    7. Add the beef stock cube. Add a little water if necessary.
    8. Stir in the basil, oregano, chilli flakes, salt and pepper, and bay leaves.
    9. Add the marmite and Worcestershire sauce if using. These add a little extra depth of flavour but are not required.
    10. Cover the pan with a lid and leave the bolognese to simmer on a low heat for at least 45 minutes.
    11. When the bolognese is 15 minutes away from being finished, cook your pasta and garlic bread (if using).
    12. Optional - Serve some fresh basil or coriander on top of the bolognese. Usually most would opt for basil but I love coriander so I tend to use that.
    13. Serve cheese and garlic bread on the side.
