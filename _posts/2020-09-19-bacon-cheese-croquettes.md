    1. Peel and chop the potatoes into small chunks, roughly 4 cm in size. Try to get them as evenly as possible to avoid some chunks being cooked more than others.
    2. Place the chopped potatoes into a pan with cold water. Cook on a medium heat until they are soft (roughly 20 minutes - if you can break up a chunk by putting a fork into it, this is a good sign it's done).
    3. While the potatoes are cooking, grill the bacon until cooked to your liking and grate the cheese.
    4. Cut the bacon into small squares and put aside. 
    5. When the potatoes are cooked through drain the water, put the butter in and start mashing until there are no visible lumps. 
    6. Next add the grated cheese and a splash of milk and mash again, being sure to incorporate it as evenly as possible. 
    7. Stir in the bacon squares and set the mix aside to cool down for a bit until it's not too hot to touch.
    8. Meanwhile, beat the eggs and put into a bowl. Put the panko breadcrumbs into another bowl. If you don't have panko breadcrumbs, lightly toast 4-5 slices of bread and break them up in a food processor).
    9. Using your hands, mold the potato mixture into a cylinder shape.
    10. Next, dip it into the egg mixture making sure to cover evenly. Then into the breadcrumbs.
    11. Repeat until all of the mixture is used.
    12. Heat the oil in a pan over a medium to high heat. To test if it is up to temperature, put a breadcrumb in to see if it sizzles.
    13. Place 3 - 4 croquettes into the pan (depending on size) and cook evenly on each side until golden brown.
    14. Serve right away or freeze to use for a later date (up to 3 months).
