    1. Pre-cook the sausages on a barbecue for extra smokey flavour (coated in oil to avoid sticking). You can also oven cook, grill, or fry depending on preference, but be sure not to cook them all the way through. 
    2. In a sauce pan, add a splash of oil and cook the peppers, onions, garlic and thyme for 5 minutes. 
    3. Add the M7S Smoked Tomato Paste and stir in. 
    4. Add the red wine and simmer on a medium heat for 3-4 minutes.
    5. Pre-heat the oven to 180 degrees. Move the contents of the sauce pan to a ceramic dutch oven pot as shown in the main image (if you don't have one you can continue to use the saucepan with a lid).
    6. Add the butterbeans, sweet potatoes and vegetable stock, along with the pre-cooked sausages. Put the dutch oven pot into the oven for 25 minutes. Or simmer on the stove on a low heat for 25 minutes.
    7. Season to taste a scatter chopped parsley on top before serving with the crusty white bread.
