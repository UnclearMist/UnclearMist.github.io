    1. Chop the carrots, onions, garlic, mushrooms, and vegetables before cooking.
    2. Heat 1 tbsp of oil in a saucepan. Once hot, add the carrots and onions. Stir continuously on a medium heat for 4 minutes.
    3. Add two thirds of the chopped garlic to the saucepan, along with the chopped mushrooms and stir for another minute.
    4. Add the red wine, beef stock, and thyme, cook for 3 minutes whilst maintaining a medium heat.
    5. Transfer the the mix to a slow cooker on high heat and add the diced beef. This will need to cook for 3 hours.
    6. When there is an hour left on the time for the beef, begin boiling the new potatoes in cold water on a high heat for approximately 15 minutes. While the potatoes are cooking heat the oven to 200 degrees and add 3 tbsp of oil to a baking tray and allow it to heat on its own in the oven.
    7. Add the corn starch to a small amount of water in a cup until it turns to a paste. Add this mixture to the slow cooker and stir in. This will thicken the sauce slightly.
    8. When the potatoes are boiled, drain well and add them to the tray of hot oil (being careful not to splash yourself!). Season with salt, pepper, and paprika. Give them a good shake and put them back in the oven for 30 minutes.
    9. 5 minutes before the potatoes are done, heat a frying pan with a tiny amount of vegetable oil. Once hot, add the broccoli and green beans with the remaining garlic. Sautée for approximately 5 minutes or to taste. 
    10. Serve and enjoy!
