    1. Rinse 1 mug of rice in a sieve under a cold tap for 1 minute. This helps to remove excess starch so the rice won't stick together too much.
    2. Transfer the rice to a saucepan and add 2 mugs of cold water with a pinch of salt.
    3. Heat on a medium heat until the water begins to bubble slightly (not boil).
    4. Cover the saucepan with a lid and turn the heat down as low as possible. Allow to simmer for 15-20 minutes until there's no water left in the bottom. 
    5. Try not to remove the lid as much as possible. After 15 minutes lift the lid slightly using a towel and use a spoon to check for water at the bottom. This will tell you how much longer you need to keep cooking.

Using a mug as a measure for rice is the easiest way to get the rice to water ratio right for me, and it saves having to measure it out on the scales. One mug of rice requires 2 mugs of water. One mug of rice will serve 2-3 people depending on the meal. I usually keep any leftover rice in the fridge to use with a lunch the next day.
