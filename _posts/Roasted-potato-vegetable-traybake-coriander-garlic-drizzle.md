    1. Pre-heat the oven to 200 degrees. Boil the potatoes in a saucepan for 20 minutes on a medium heat.
    2. Pour 1 tbsp of vegetable oil onto a large tray and spread evenly. Put it in the oven on its own to heat up while the potatoes cook.
    3. Chop and prepare the vegetables and chorizo (if using).
    4. Butter the corn on the cobs (1 tbsp of butter for 2 corns) and wrap in aluminium foil. Place onto a separate baking tray.
    5. Drain the potatoes, transfer to the heated tray whilst wearing oven mitts (be careful not to splash yourself with hot oil). Sprinkle with salt, pepper and a small coat of smoked paprika. Shake the tray to combine the seasoning.
    6. Cook potatoes and corn into the oven for 20 minutes.
    7. Combine the olive oil, coriander, garlic and lemon juice and blitz in a food processor (if you don't have one finely chop the coriander and garlic and combine with oil and lemon juice in a bowl).
    8. After the potatoes have cooked for 20 minutes, add the vegetables, chorizo, and drizzle shake to mix well. If you need more oil add another tsp of olive oil on top and shake again, but remember vegetables release a lot of water whilst cooking so don't overdo it.
    9. Cook for another 20 minutes. Serve altogether.

You can make this dish vegetarian by removing the chorizo, and vegan by not cooking the corn in butter or using a vegan substitute.
